	Section 4: Non-Static Members and their execution control flow

	Lecture 31 - Non Static Members
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	Any functionality that is specific to a particular object of a class should be defined as non-static member in the class.
	
	There can be four non-static members -
	
	1. Non Static Variable
	2. Non Static Block
	3. Non Static User Method
	4. Constructor
	
	These are similar to the static counter parts like static variable, static block, static user method except for the constructor 
	which takes the place of the main method. 
	
	The main method is always a static method instead we have a constructor here in this case.
	
	To access these four, we need to create an object of a class because these are very specific to a particular object. 
	
	And we can create this object inside any of the static members like main method, a static block or a user defined method.

	So we define an object and then we access them.
